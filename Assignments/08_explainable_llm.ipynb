I had originally beeen trying to analyze a dataset I created and an LLM model I finetuned for the purposes of deciding which type of CT to perform for a given set of clinical paramaters and trying to do counterfactual examples, but this was not working so instead am looking at this more straightforward problem (the math Q and A).\n",
