I had originally beeen trying to analyze a dataset I created and an LLM model I finetuned for the purposes of deciding which type of CT to perform for a given set of clinical paramaters and trying to do counterfactual examples, but this was not working so instead am looking at this more straightforward problem (the math Q and A).\n",

This demonstrates a sensitivity to added noise, where extraneous numbers in the prompt led the model astray.\n",

Here, the model provided an answer based on the total people (847) instead of solving the initial equation; possibly, the added context about “pi” may have interfered with the model's understanding of the problem structure. This shows how certain phrases can inadvertently redirect model attention away from the problem’s critical elements.\n",

The model instead outputted a mid-step result, indicating that it either skipped a step or cut the computation process short, potentially due to the competing focus introduced by the extraneous information.\n",
